To run the Vue app, you'll need to set up a development environment with a local server. Here's how you can do it:

    Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). Choose the LTS version for better stability.

    Create a new project folder: Create a new folder for your project. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command to initialize a new project:

bash

npm init -y

    Install Vue and Vuetify: In the same terminal or command prompt, run the following command to install Vue.js and Vuetify as project dependencies:

bash

npm install vue@next @vuetify/vue3-compatible@next vuetify@2.5.8

    Create the necessary files: Create index.html and app.js files with the code provided in the previous response. Place them in the project folder.

    Start a local server: To run the app locally, you can use the http-server package. Install it globally by running the following command:

bash

npm install -g http-server

    Start the local server: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

bash

http-server

This command starts a local server and provides you with a URL where you can access the app. Usually, it will be http://localhost:8080/.

Open your web browser and visit the provided URL. You should see the supplies tracking app dashboard rendered in the browser.

Remember to keep the terminal or command prompt running to keep the local server active. If you make changes to the code, you may need to stop the server (by pressing Ctrl+C) and start it again to see the updated version.

That's it! You have successfully run the supplies tracking app built with Vue.js and Vuetify. Feel free to customize the code, add more features, and style the dashboard according to your requirements.
